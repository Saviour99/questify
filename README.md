## Introduction
 ### The Project
 Questify is a web app that simplifies quiz creation for students and educators by generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from uploaded course materials, including PDFs, text files, and slide presentations. It uses text extraction algorithms to analyze the content and generate random MCQs, with each question including four answer options and a correct answer, providing an engaging learning experience.

 ### Inspiration
As a student at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), specifically during my third and final year at the School of Business, I faced a significant challenge that many students could relate to: the limited access to past exam questions. This limitation left me relying solely on the materials provided by lecturers, which made it difficult to fully assess my understanding of the topics I studied. Without the opportunity to practice with real exam questions, I felt unprepared for the kinds of questions I would face in exams

This experience drove me to take action and create a solution not just for myself, but for other students as well. I developed Questify, a web application designed to bridge this gap by offering students easy access to a platform where they can generate and practice multiple-choice questions. My goal is to provide students at KNUST and beyond with the tools they need to test and strengthen their understanding of the material truly, ultimately making learning more effective and accessible for all.

 ### The Context
This is my Portfolio Project, concluding my Foundations Year at Holberton School. I chose what I wanted to work on, as long as I presented a working program at the end of the development stage.
